// assumoing we have an array of fruits

const fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'grapes'];

// how to have a fruit that is not an array but a linkedlist
// linkedlist: orange --> apple --> banner


// the end of a list points to null

// linked list are better than array or hashtables
// linkedlist are scattered all over memory while array are always located right to each other

// iterating/traversing in a linkedlist is quite slower than iterating in an array. but the insert we can add in the middle is what
// makes linkedlist better than using an array, you can also delete nodes in linkedlist easily than arrays. the nodes are in order as well compared to harshtables


// prepend() O(1)
// append() O(1)
// lookup() O(n)
// insert() O(n)
// delete() O(n)

// pointers are like reference in memory for example

const student = {name: "adeola"};
const refe = student
console.log(refe);
